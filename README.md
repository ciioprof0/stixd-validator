# STIX Description Validator (stixd-validator)
The STIX Description Validator ensures that STIX 2.1 description instances adhere to the STIX Description controlled natural language (stixd-cnl). This validator is non-normative tool. In cases of conflict with the STIX 2.1 specification, the specification takes precedence.

**Note:** This initial proof-of-concept version focuses on validating descriptions in STIX Domain Object 4.6: Indicator, specifically those describing a spearphishing with attachment event (MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1566.001).
